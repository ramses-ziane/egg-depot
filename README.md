Game overview: this game is supposed to contribute to the charity ducks unlimited, url: https://www.ducks.org/ . 
Current progress can be found on url https://www.notion.so/Duck-Island-a3f7a03a3e8f478c94d671673a9854b6?p=8c843bcdd78241e6bb37c6fdc6b3e39c&pm=s
This game plans to play off of rubber duck decoding, a commonly known analagy to those studying comupter science.
The game will be an educational tool for players to learn about ducks.
The game will be uploaded online (not an app) and all players will have a public icon that resembles a rubber duck.
Players can have a choice of which type of duck they want their rubber duck to model. 
The game board will resemble a map with different islands, each island will have a module that teaches users about the different
types of ducks found in that area. 

How do we contribute money to ducks unlimited? My current idea is to allow users to donate purely from free will and/or
users can buy a rubber duck off the game and all profits go to ducks unlimited and/or users can pay a one time fee to play 
the game which will be donated to charity.
